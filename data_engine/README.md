# Data Engine of MINIMA (CVPR 2025) for Multi-modal Image Generation

MINIMA Data Engine is an open-source project that integrates cutting-edge methods from the community to enable
multi-modal transformations.  
Currently, the engine supports the following modalities:

</div>

## Online Demo

The online demo is under development. Stay tuned!

## Environment Setup

The engine requires the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r engine_extra_requirements.txt
```

## Checkpoints Preparation

We recommend placing all checkpoints in the `data_engine/weights` directory.  
The `download_weights.sh` script can be used to download all the required weights and place them in the correct
directory following the instructions below:

```bash
cd data_engine
bash download_weights.sh
```

You can also download the weights manually and place them in the `data_engine/weights` directory.    
The weight files should maintain the exact folder structure shown below for the program to locate them correctly:

<p></p> <details> <summary><b> Weight Files Structure </b></summary>  

The directory structure should be like this:

```
weights/
├── stylebooth/
│ ├── step-210000/
│ └── stylebooth-tb-5000-0.bin
├── clip-vit-large-patch14/
│ ├── tokenizer.json
│ └── ...
├── depth_anything_v2/
│ └── depth_anything_v2_vitl.pth
├── dsine/

└── anime_to_sketch/
  └── improved.bin
```

### Per-Modality Weight Download Instructions

<p></p> <details> <summary><b> Infrared Generation </b></summary>  

The infrared generation code is based on [scepter](https://github.com/modelscope/scepter)

Please
download the weights
from [styleBooth weights](https://huggingface.co/scepter-studio/stylebooth/tree/main/models), [clip-vit-large-patch14](https://huggingface.co/openai/clip-vit-large-patch14).      
And our style tuner is available for download
from

  <summary><b> Event Generation </b></summary>

The event generation module is a simple simulation implemented with basic code.

> **NOTE:** Since this is a simulated process, no checkpoint is required.

## MINIMA Data Engine

To run the engine, you can use the following command:

```bash
cd data_engine
python modality_engine.py --modality <modality> --input_path <input_path> --output_dir <output_dir>
# --modality: Choose from [infrared, depth, event, normal, sketch, paint]
# --input_path: Supports both a single image or a directory that contains images

# Example
python modality_engine.py --modality infrared --input_path ./figs/origin_image.jpg --output_dir './result'
```
